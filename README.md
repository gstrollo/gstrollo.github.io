# G.STROLLO bloggy blog
I think I've tried to delete this 5 times to start over, but this is going to be my final final v5.0_final_FINALEDIT :)
Github Pages project to mess with and attempt to build a blog. I really didn't love using Jekyll, and may even document my learning on this blog, but for now this is going to be a static HTML/CSS scratch made site.
